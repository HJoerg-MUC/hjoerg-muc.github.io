# Cover Letter

I suggest four paragraphs:
1. opening paragraph: background (who are you and how did you come
across this post)
2. paragraph II: why are you the perfect match (skills, experience, etc.)
3. paragraph III: why are you the perfect match (social skills, team
   work, etc.)
4. closing paragraph: say thanks and ask for follow-up

# CV

CAVE: some countries/cultures, don't want too much personal
information (like your photograph or birthdate/-place). Check first.

# Use LaTeX's moderncv-class

Please enjoy LaTeX's
[moderncv](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv)-class. Here's the
[documentation](file:///home/zieglerk/moderncv_userguide.v2.pdf) and
my four favourite:

- \cvlistitem{item}
- \cvitem{header}{text}
- \cvitemwithcomment{header}{text}{comment}
- \cventry{years}{degree/job
  title}{institution/employer}{localization}{optional:
  grade/...}{optional: comment/job description}
- \cventry{when}{what}{at institution}{in city}{opt: grade}{opt: description}
