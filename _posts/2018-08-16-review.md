teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

# If your paper gets rejected ...

... here's (maybe) a little bit of consolation/perspective: In the "NIPS
2014 experiment"[1], a tenth of the submitted papers (166) went through the
review process twice independently (three reviewers and one area chair,
respectively, dealing with it). Out of the 38 papers accepted by the
first chair, 22 were rejected by the second. Similarly in the opposite
direction. In other words (assuming uniform distribution of
disagreement), more than
half of the accepted papers (57%) would have been rejected if reviewed a
second time.
