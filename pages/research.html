  	    <h4 id="crypto">Cryptographic Protocols</h4>
  	    <p>Alice and Bob are two millionaires. They want to
  	      determine who is richer, but do not want to disclose
  	      their actual wealth. A possible solution is to provide a
  	      trusted third party with their accounts' balances and
  	      let this party announce who is richer. The use this
  	      crutch is unsatisfactory and leaves every cryptographer
  	      with an uncomfortable feeling. Through <i>secure
  	      multi-party computations</i>, we provide Alice and Bob
  	      with a protocol to jointly compute the answer to their
  	      question using cryptographic primitives instead of a
  	      trusted third party.</p>

  	    <p>Cryptography's model of users is quite simplistic:
  	      every user is either good or bad. Game theory offers a
  	      more nuanced version: every participant is trying to
  	      achieve his or her individual goals and behaves
  	      "rationally" in order to do so. We revisit multi-party
  	      computations with such rational players and arrive at
  	      surprising results.</p>

      	    <p>By the way, the example above is the
 	      classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao%27s_Millionaires%27_Problem">Yao's
 	      Millionaires' Problem</a>. A recent application is the
 	      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin
 	      cryptocurrency</a>, where the users jointly compute the
 	      "history" of transactions.</p>


  	    <h4 id="ml">Machine Learning</h4>
    	    <blockquote>All models are wrong, but some are useful.<br>
	      <cite class="author">-- George Box</cite></blockquote>

  	    <p>The majority of attacks on cryptosystems is statistical,
  	      ranging from frequency analysis (of human languages) to
  	      correlations (of bit patterns). Differential and linear
  	      cryptanalysis are prime examples of the latter.</p>

  	    <p>The classic field of statistics has gotten a fresh
  	      impulse from the emergence of artificial
  	      intelligence/machine learning in the last century. Both
  	      being based on huge amounts of data, they offer different
  	      perspectives. We take this as inspiration to attack
  	      cryptosystems using machine-learning methods.</p>

  	    <h4 id="polys">Polynomials over Finite Fields</h4>
  	    <p>Polynomials appear all over mathematics and computer
  	      science. They inherit many basic notions from the
  	      integers, e.g. primality and squarefreeness. But the
  	      absence of carries for sums and products of
  	      polynomials makes them more accessible.</p>

	    <p>In the business of understanding polynomials, we
  	      measure our success by our ability to count the ones
  	      with certain properties -- approximately and
  	      exactly. From this point of view, I approached:</p>
  	      <ul>
  		<li>special multivariate polynomials,</li>
  		<li>decomposable univariate polynomials.</li>
  	      </ul>

  	    <p>The decomposition of polynomials has many applications.</p>
  	    <ul>
	      <li>In the field of signal processing, its application
	      to the Fourier transform improves the transmission
	      rate.</li>
	      <li>It is closely related to the factorization of
	      projective polynomials. These play a prominent role in
	      the recent advances on the discrete logarithm
	      problem.</li>
	      <li>It is closely related to the factorization of skew
	      polynomials. This problem is at the heart of some
	      cryptographic key-exchanges.</li>
  	      <li>It is the underlying structure of iterated block
  	      ciphers. Then decomposition is equivalent to
  	      breaking.</li>
  	      <li>Finally, you find it in Beethoven's
  	      compositions.</li>
  	    </ul>
