I am a researcher, teacher, and administrator with interests in information hiding and retrieval. So, I do cryptography and machine learning. My [research]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/research.md %}) page offers more detailed descriptions. I also enjoy the occasional game theory and play volleyball.

I studied mathematics, physics, and computer science at universities in [Munich](https://www.tum.de/), [Montr√©al](http://www.mcgill.ca/), [Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), [Bonn](http://www3.uni-bonn.de/), and [Passau](http://www.uni-passau.de/en/). I am now professor at the [University of Applied Sciences in Landshut](https://www.haw-landshut.de/en.html).

You can find my articles and software under [publications]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/research.md %}). And my courses and presentations are filed under [teachings]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/research.md %}) and [talks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/research.md %}), respectively.
